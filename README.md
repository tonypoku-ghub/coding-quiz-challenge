# coding-quiz-challenge

In this assignment I built a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

Very limited HTML was used, most of the removal and addition of elements was executed using JavaScript. Also in play was the use of CSS to control the display of sections of the html document.

The complete game can be accessed from
